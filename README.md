Gymnastics Style Workout Circuit Generator

This is a personal project intended as practice for myself
Using exercises collected over years of gymnastics training Workout circuits are generated which can be used for developing the necessary strength to do impressive strength holds like planches and front levers.

Would best be used for Gymnastics/Calisthenics/Crossfit training as many of the moves require equipment and maybe a coach to assist in doing the actual move
